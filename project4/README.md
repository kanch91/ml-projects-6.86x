# Project 4: Collaborative Filtering via Gaussian Mixtures
  - part2-nn/neural_nets.py in which you'll implement your first neural net from scratch
  - kmeans where we have implemented a baseline using the K-means algorithm
  - naive_em.py where you will implement a first version of the EM algorithm (tabs 3-4)
  - em.py where you will build a mixture model for collaborative filtering (tabs 7-8)
  - common.py where you will implement the common functions for all models (tab 5)
  - main.py where you will write code to answer the questions for this project
  - test.py where you will write code to test your implementation of EM for a given test case
 
 
 Following are the details of the data files:
  - toy_data.txt a 2D dataset that you will work with in tabs 2-5
  - netflix_incomplete.txt the netflix dataset with missing entries to be completed
  - netflix_complete.txt the netflix dataset with missing entries completed
  - test_incomplete.txt a test dataset to test for you to test your code against our implementation
  - test_complete.txt a test dataset to test for you to test your code against our implementation
  - test_solutions.txt a test dataset to test for you to test your code against our implementation
