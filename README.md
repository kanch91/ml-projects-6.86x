# Project 2: Digit Recognition (Part I)
  In this project, you have been familiarized with the MNIST dataset for digit recognition, a popular task in computer vision. You have implemented a linear regression which turned out to be inadequate for this task. You have also learned how to use scikit-learn's SVM for binary  classification and multiclass classification. Then, you have implemented your own softmax regression using gradient descent. Finally, you experimented with different hyperparameters, different labels and different features, including kernelized features.

# Project 3: Digit Recognition (Part II)
  - part2-nn/neural_nets.py in which you'll implement your first neural net from scratch
  - part2-mnist/nnet_fc.py where you'll start using PyTorch to classify MNIST digits
  - part2-mnist/nnet_conv.py where you will use convolutional layers to boost performance
  - part2-twodigit/mlp.py and part2-twodigit/conv.py which are for a new, more difficult version of the MNIST dataset
